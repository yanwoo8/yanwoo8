## 🌱 Welcome to My Developer Journey! 🌱

I’m an aspiring developer, just starting out on this exciting path.  
**All my code** is open to criticism, feedback, and guidance — no matter how blunt! 🙇‍♂️  
In fact, **the harsher**, the better. 🙏  
Feel free to offer your insights, suggestions, or even "tough love" — it’s all welcome! 💪
